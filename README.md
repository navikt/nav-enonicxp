**Obs:** Release must be formatted as **vX.X.X** (e.g v1.2.1)

 __*__ PR between master and develop
1. Make a pull request between master and develop
2. Name it "Release: < iso-date of the release> "
3. Write release notes in the comment. Remember to get links to the jira tasks.
  Optimally we get the whole text from Jira when doing the release there. For
  now just check how a previous release pull request looks. Bullet list with
  link to issue and short description.
4. Set the label **Release** on the pull request.
5. After code review merge the pull request to master
6. Deploy the code to production
